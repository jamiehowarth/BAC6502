APPENDIX 3 : USING THE EDT EDITOR ON VAX/VMSIf you are using the sideways ROM version of BBC KERMIT on a model B, oreither version on a B+, B+128 or Master 128, you will be able to use theEDT screen editor on VAX/VMS mainframes to edit your files. This Appendixdescribes how you should set up your job to do this, and how the BBCComputer's function keys are used to control the editor.If you are using the RAM version of BBC KERMIT on a model B, whichemulates only a 40 character wide teletype, you will still be able to useEDT, but only in line mode.A3.1 SETTING UP THE TERMINAL DETAILSIn order to use the full facilities of the EDT editor you must, of course,set BBC KERMIT to provide a VT52 terminal emulation. This is the defaultsetting, but if you have changed the terminal type you can return to VT52mode with the command  SET TERMINAL VT52before you use the CONNECT command to enter terminal mode.Depending on how the VAX/VMS system has been set up, you may also need toconfigure it to know that your terminal is a VT52 and not, for instance, aVT100. You can see what VMS thinks your terminal is by issuing the DCLcommand  $ SHOW TERMINALduring a job. If the default terminal type is a VT52, you need take nofurther action: EDT will automatically adapt itself to use the correctscreen control commands.If, though, the default terminal type is not a VT52, you will need to takesome action. You can do one of several things here:1. If you are connected to your VAX system with a directly connectedpermanent line, you could ask your system manager to set the terminalcharacteristics that VMS will use. This will be permanent, and once it isdone the default terminal type for that line will be a VT52. This willnot, though, be possible if you are using some sort of network to link youto the VAX system.2. Whenever you start a terminal job, you could issue the command  $ SET TERMINAL/DEVICE=VT52to tell VMS that you are using a VT52. You must do this before you use the EDT editor (or anything else, such as MAIL, that sends screen-controlcharacters). You could include the command in your LOGIN.COM file to saveyou having to remember to issue it every time: however, the terminal typewill then be wrong if you ever use a device that is not a VT52.3. You could include in your LOGIN.COM file the command  $ SET TERM/INQUIREThis will make VMS send an "inquiry sequence" to the terminal when you login: BBC KERMIT will then identify itself as a VT52, and VMS will setitself up accordingly. This is probably the preferable method, since itwill adapt itself automatically whatver device type you use. However,there are some drawbacks. If you use a device that does not respond  tothe inquiry sequence you will see some rubbish charaters appear, and loginmay be slowed down slightly: also, any commands you type while waiting forthe login sequence to complete will be discarded. There is also theproblem that some peculiar terminals (ICL terminals are apparently badhere) may interpret the inquiry sequence as something else entirely, andmay do something strange or even stop working altogether.A3.2 EDIT KEYPAD KEYSAs we saw in section 4.4, the models B, B+ and B+128 do not possess keyscorresponding to the VT52 keypad, so BBC KERMIT emulates them using thered function keys. Section 4.4 specified the actual ESCAPE sequences thatthe keys will send to the host computer in VT52 mode: here we shallconsider the use of the keys in terms of the EDT editor. If you have aMaster 128 you will be able to use the keypad keys to send the ESCAPEsequences.A3.2.1 Models B, B+ and B+128These machines do not have keypads, so you will need to use the redfunction keys to send the ESCAPE sequences to EDT. Note that some editorfunctions are invoked by pressing a sequence of keys: in the list below	F3indicates that you should press key F3, and	SHIFT-F1/F3indicates that you should press SHIFT-F1 (the GOLD function) then F3.	BBC key sequence	VT52 keypad key	EDT function	SHIFT-F1		PF1		GOLD	SHIFT-F2		PF2		HELP	SHIFT-F3		PF3		DELETE LINE	SHIFT-F1/SHIFT-F3	GOLD/PF1	UNDELETE LINE	SHIFT-F7		PERIOD		SELECT	SHIFT-F1/SHIFT-F7	GOLD/PERIOD	RESET	SHIFT-F8		ENTER		ENTER	SHIFT-F1/SHIFT-F8	GOLD/ENTER	SUBS	F0			0		LINE	SHIFT-F1/F0		GOLD/0		OPEN LINE	F1			1		WORD	SHIFT-F1/F1		GOLD/1		CHANGE CASE	F2			2		EOL	SHIFT-F1/F2		GOLD/2		DELETE EOL	F3			3		CUT	SHIFT-F1/F3		GOLD/3		PASTE	F4			4		ADVANCE	SHIFT-F1/F4		GOLD/F1		BOTTOM	F5			5		BACKUP	SHIFT-F1/F5		GOLD/5		TOP	F6			6		DELETE CHAR	SHIFT-F1/F6		GOLD/F6		UNDELETE CHAR	F7			7		PAGE	SHIFT-F1/F7		GOLD/7		COMMAND	F8			8		FIND NEXT	SHIFT-F1/F8		GOLD/8		FIND	F9			9		DELETE WORD	SHIFT-F1/F9		GOLD/9		UNDELETE WORD	UP			UP		CURSOR-UP	SHIFT-F1/UP		GOLD/UP		REPLACE	DOWN			DOWN		CURSOR-DOWN	SHIFT-F1/DOWN		GOLD/DOWN	SECT	RIGHT			RIGHT		CURSOR-RIGHT	SHIFT-F1/RIGHT		GOLD/RIGHT	SPECINS	LEFT			LEFT		CURSOR-LEFT	SHIFT-F1/LEFT		GOLD/LEFT	APPENDA3.3.2 The Master 128This machine possesses a keypad to the right of the main keyboard, and thearrangement of these keys closely parallels what you would find on a realterminal. The key arrangement differs most in that the cursor keys on areal VT52 are in the keypad area: on the Master they are separate, and thekeypad keys that occupy these positions are not used.The keypad sends EDT control sequences as follows. If the key diagramshows two functions, the upper one is selected by pressing the key alone,and the lower is obtained by first pressing GOLD, then pressing the key.  ---------------------------------  !	   !	   !	   !	   !  !
