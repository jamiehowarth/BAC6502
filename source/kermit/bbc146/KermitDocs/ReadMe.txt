The main ones are:  - New command line options have been added. They are:          -Mn     Switches to screen mode n before assembly starts          -W      Instructs the assembler to wait after outputting an error                  message until a key is pressed (actioned only if the listing                  is being sent to the screen)          -G      Instructs the Assembler not to pause at the end of assembly,                  but restart the calling language immediately. The default                  action is to pause unless the calling language is BASIC  - The command line syntax has been extended, so that options can be set in    a shorter way. Thus          *ASSEMBLE SOURCE -B6 -L2 -W    could be written as          *ASSEMBLER SOURCE -B6L2W    The "-O" flag for the object file is now optional, and the assembler will    take the second parameter of the command as the object file name *unless*    it begins with a "-". Thus          *ASSEMBLE SOURCE -OBIN    can be written          *ASSEMBLE SOURCE BIN  - If the assembler is fitted as the highest priority language, pressing    CONTROL-BREAK or powering on will enter it in CLI mode. MOS commands can    then be issued to change to another language if required.  - A new service command *MODE n allows you to change screen mode to n even    when in CLI mode and the BASIC MODE statement is not available.  - The assembler will exit to the language ROM that called it, rather than    restarting BASIC.  - Bugs in the initialisation code have been cleared so the assembler can now    be started from any language, and will start reliably on second processors  - Control keys can be used to direct assembly actions while the assembly is    under way. They are:          f0..f3  Force list level to change to 0..3 . After pressing one of                  these keys, LST directives are processed but not actioned.                  CONTROL-L resets the list level to that set by the last                  LST directive encountered.          CTRL-Q  Outputs a report showing the number of the next line to be                  processed          CTRL-W  Reverses the current wait-after-error action          CTRL-P  Reverses the current state of the list-to-printer option          CTRL-N  Turns paged scroll mode on          CTRL-O  Turns paged scroll mode off          CTRL-H  Displays help information about key usage          SPACE   Pauses assembly until a key is pressed - Tab handling in the listing is extended, so that they are set at every 8   character positions in the operand and comment fields. - A new directive SYSCLI allows MOS commands to be issued from the source   during assembly. - The strings output by DISP and similar directives can include |M or |J   to start a new line, or |G to ring the bell. - New directives CASC and CSTR plant "counted strings". They are similar to    ASC and STR, but precede the string itself with a byte giving the length of   the string. (On version 1.32 the ALEN directive could be used in a macro   to do this, but control-characters and those with B7 set, selected as   |X and ^X, would be counted as 2, rather than 1, character) - For symmetry, extra data planting directives have been added, so that                DFB   and   DB    plant bytes                DFDB  and   DDB   plant low-high words                DFW   and   DW    plant high-low words                DFS   and   DS    reserve space - A new directive DEFPARS allows defaults to be specified for macro    parameters. - *HELP ASSEMBLER gives information on command usage. - The opcode mnemonic CLR has been added as a synonym of STZ, for    compatibility with the mnemonics in the BASIC assembler. - The character "\" can now be used to flag the start of comment - Hexadecimal constants can be begun with a "&" character (in fact, they   always could - the 1.32 User Guide was wrong!) - Error reporting has been enhanced, so that where appropriate the message   will indicate the position in the line the error occurred. - Screen output in mode 0 now correctly uses a width of 80 bytes, rather than   40. - Saved Wordwise files can be input directly as source, providing they   contain no embedded commands. The Wordwise TAB character (shown as a right-   arrow on screen) is accepted as a "real" TAB.Full details of the Assembler are contained in the User Guide, which has beenexpanded with much greater descriptive detail.----------------------------------------------From:	SYSKERMIT@UK.AC.LANCS.VAX1 "UK Kermit Distribution"Date:	24-FEB-1987 09:32Subj:	Update to Lancaster 65C02 AssemblerVersion 1.52 of the Lancaster 65C02 Assembler is now available. This is a bug-fix release, and contains no extra user facilities. Problems fixed are: - Immediate operands can be negative numbers. Thus expressions such as                          LDA   #-1   now work, planting, in this case, A9 FF as you would expect. The expression   will still be rejected if loss of the most significant byte would cause a   change of sign. - The 65C02-only mnemonics INA and DEA now produce the correct opcodes (Note   that this problem was already fixed in versiin 1.5T as broadcast by BBC   Telesoftware) - An EXEC file can be used to provide the replies to the QUERY directive. In   1.50 the replies were taken as keypresses and were ignored. - The symbol table listing is not corrupted if SPACE is pressed while it is   being generated - JSR to a zero-page address is correctly assembled. In 1.50 it was treated as   an invalid addressing mode. - DS with an operand of zero now leaves a zero-length gap rather than a 64K    gap - Repeat counts > 255 in DFB, etc, now work correctly
